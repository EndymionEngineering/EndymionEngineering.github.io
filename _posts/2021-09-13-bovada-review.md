I have been a longstanding customer of Bovada, and I often place sportsbook bets on my favorite teams. My experience has been terrific! I am a resident of Texas so everything is completely legal. In addition, I find that deposits are simple to make.

I usually use Coinbase to withdraw money from my checking account (ACH transfer) for no fees. I then trade USD for LTC, and send that Litecoin to Bovada. The experience is seamless, and I'm not losing any money in this process to high fees.
Once on Bovada the UI works great and the betting lines are always very competitive. Try your luck today!
