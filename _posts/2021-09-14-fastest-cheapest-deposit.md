Whenever I want to deposit money into Bovada, I use cryptocurrency. For those unfamiliar, this is digital currency. The problem is there are so many choices, and MOST choices comes with high fees. I have a solution for this.

At the time of this writing, a bitcoin transaction fee is $3! That eats away into your potential winnigs quickly, especially if you are making multiple deposits. I highly reccomend thta you use another coin supported by Bovada, which is *Litecoin*.

Here's what you can do. Creat an account on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jdistler) and link your checking account. This is the cheapest way to get crypto, using a card takes high fees. 

Now use Coinbase's easy UI to buy Litcoin. Finally you can hit "Send" and send the litecoin to Bovada using the address Bovada provides after hitting Deposit -> Litecoin.
